# ACI Project
- Project for ACI course of University of Rennes 1 - Master 2 Cloud Computing & Services.

## Description
University practical laboratory/PCs room has always been a place that every students, professors go to whenever they have practical sessions/classes. However, for (some) students, it is also a suitable place for studying, using PCs in case they do not own a personal ones, or even printing documents, lectures, etc. with public printers. Therefore, there is always a chance that all rooms have been revesrved/taken for whatever reasons and the student can no longer use it for their purpose. Considering how large and how many classes an University can have, students are not capable of checking schedule of the University for a single room that they want to use.
For the sakes of students, by using noise decetion technique along with fog computing concept, this project hopes to deliver a better, easier solution for students to know whether a practical room has been reserved/taken or not.
